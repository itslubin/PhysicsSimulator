# Physics Simulator
App designed to provide an intuitive and captivating experience of simulating celestial bodies' movements in outer space.

## Inspiration 💭
When I was in high school, teachers tended to explain physics with a lot of formulas and very few graphical explanations. As a visual learner, I struggled sometimes to understand Newton's Law of Attraction and bodies movement in outer space. Additionally, I was not the only one struggling with this issue. This inspired me to develop Physics Simulator, an app devoted to serving those needs for a deeper understanding in physics laws and bodies movement.

## What it does 🖥
Physics Simulator transcends the confines of traditional learning, offering a hands-on experience in comprehending the principles of physics and celestial mechanics. This app allows you to create and manipulate scenarios by adjusting essential parameters such as mass, velocity, and position. Through an intuitive interface, you can unleash your creativity and explore how changes in these factors influence the motion of objects, planets, stars, and more.

📁 **Data Collection in JSON**: After running a simulation, easily collect your results in JSON file format. This feature facilitates data analysis, sharing findings with others, or integrating the simulation outputs into other applications for further research and exploration.

🪐 **Select Physics Laws and Apply**: Apply different physics laws to grouped bodies to observe how distinct laws impact the movement and interactions of bodies.

👨🏻‍💻 **Visual Insights**: The app opens a new dialog to show the current celestial bodies movement distributed in their respectives groups, the simulation can be stopped at the starting menu.

🧑🏻‍🎓 **Educational and Inspirational**: Beyond its entertainment value, this app serves as an educational tool that sparks curiosity and fosters a deeper understanding of space science. Teachers can incorporate the app into their curriculum, allowing students to engage actively with astronomical concepts.

## Target client 👤
Whether you're a space enthusiast, a student, an educator, or simply curious about the mysteries of the universe, this app is your gateway to understanding the dynamics of planets, stars, moons, and other celestial entities in an interactive and user-friendly manner.

## What I learned 📚
During the process of building this program, I encountered different bugs related to JSON formatting and its casting to arrays. This helped me to practise with the casting of JSON into arrays and then, rearraging all this information to their respectives classes. Also, it helped me a lot refreshing my physics from high school!
