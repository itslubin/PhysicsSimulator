# Physics Simulator
App designed to provide an intuitive and captivating experience of simulating celestial bodies' movements in outer space.

## Inspiration ðŸ’­
When I was in high school, teachers tended to explain physics with a lot of formulas and very few graphical explanations. As a visual learner, I struggled sometimes to understand Newton's Law of Attraction and bodies movement in outer space. Additionally, I was not the only one struggling with this issue. This inspired me to develop Physics Simulator, an app devoted to serving those needs for a deeper understanding in physics laws and bodies movement.
